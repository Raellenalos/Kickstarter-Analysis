# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview of Project
Assist client to successfully plan crowdfunding campaign to fund her upcoming play by providing an in-depth analysis of Kickstarter data to determine trends. 

### Purpose
Analyze crowdfunding data to determine the effects of campaign launch dates; goals and other factors on a campaign’s success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
May yielded the most successful and the most failed campaigns. Simply because, May was the busiest campaign months compared to the other months with June as a close second. Comparing May’s success/failure rate to other months that had less campaigns is not a good indication of the success/ failure ratio. 

Comparing the rate of success/ failure of months that are closer in total of campaigns launch would be a more accurate analysis

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The top two months that launched the most succesful campaigns were May and June.

Although May had the most succesful campaigns, it also had the most failed campaigns.

The cancellation of campaigns remained consistent from May to December. January having the highest amount of cancelled campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most succesful campaings are less than $5,000 
The most failed campaigns are $45,000 or more 
There are no succesful campaigns in the range of $45,000 to $49,999
The highest succes rate is 76%


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There are some outliers in the data set 
About 50 campaigns are still live therefore not 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
The effect of the lenght of time a campaign remains open on it's success or failure by creating time ranges 
less than 30 days 
30 to 39 days 
40 to 49 days 
50 to 59 days 
60 to 69 days 
70 to 79 days 
80 to 89 days 
90 of more days
