# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Assist client to successfully plan crowdfunding campaign to fund her upcoming play by providing an in-depth analysis of Kickstarter data to determine trends. 

### Purpose
Analyze crowdfunding data to determine the effects of campaign launch dates; goals and other factors on a campaign’s success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges
1.   Analyzed the percentage of campaigns funding to determine how close a campaign came to reaching or exceeding their funding goal. 
2.	Determine the historical contribution to campaigns by looking at the average donations
3.	Split campaign categories into Parent and sub-categories to have a more focused data group
4.	Created pivot tables to display outcomes of each of the fundraising categories and how well they faired 
5.	Analyzed the correlation between length of fundraiser and success.
6.	Focused on Edinburgh research 
7.	Measured data’s central Tendency and Spread


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* Analyzed the outcomes of theater campaigns based on their launch date by graphing theater outcomes vs Launch date to give a view of monthly successful vs failed and canceled campaigns. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
* Analyzed the outcome of campaigns based on the percentage of success or failure of their goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 - May yielded the most successful and the most failed campaigns. Simply because, May was the busiest campaign months compared to the other months with June as a close second. Comparing May’s success/failure rate to other months that had less campaigns is not a good indication of the success/ failure ratio. 

- Comparing the rate of success/ failure of months that are closer in total of campaigns launch would be a more accurate analysis

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* The top two months that launched the most succesful campaigns were May and June.

* Although May had the most succesful campaigns, it also had the most failed campaigns.

* The cancellation of campaigns remained consistent from May to December. January having the highest amount of cancelled campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  * The most succesful campaings are less than $5,000 
  * The most failed campaigns are $45,000 or more 
  * There are no succesful campaigns in the range of $45,000 to $49,999
  * The highest succes rate is 76%


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  * There are some outliers in the data set.
  * About 50 campaigns are still live therefore not contibutng towards thet final Success and failure numbers. 
  * The Dataset is sligtly positively skewed 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  * The effect of the lenght of time a campaign remains open on it's success or failure by creating time ranges.

  | Time Range| 
  | ------------- |
  |less than 30 days| 
  |30 to 39 days| 
  |40 to 49 days| 
  |50 to 59 days| 
  |60 to 69 days| 
  |70 to 79 days| 
  |80 to 89 days| 
  |90 or more days|

- Comparing the rate of success/ failure of months that are closer in total of campaigns launch would be a more accurate analysis. 
 
- However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.
